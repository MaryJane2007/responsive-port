                <p>I'm Ifezuoke Mmesoma.</p>

<p>I am a Frontend web developer,when I finished my secondary education in 2023,I decided to travel to my sister's place in Lagos state,
before now I have never heard of anything like coding or software development,so she introduced me to it and I started taking many courses both on udemy,coursera,freecodecamp and all others,
it was really nice and tough at the same time.</p>

<p>but today I'm working as a software developer in a very big company.</p> 
<p>I am familiar with HTML5,CSS3 and JavaScript.</p>
